Testing Types:

• Fake objects actually have working implementations, but usually take some shortcuts which makes them not suitable for production. A good example of this is an in-memory database.

• Mocks are pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive. They can throw an exception if they receive a call they don’t expect and are checked during verification to ensure they got all the calls they were expecting.

• Spies are stubs that also record some information based on how they were called. One form of this might be an email service that records how many messages it was sent.

• Stubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside what’s programmed in for the test.

All of these rely on having function interfaces that have the ability to "play" predetermined responses, and "record" various invocations.
